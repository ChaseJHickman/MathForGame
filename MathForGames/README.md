This is a program meant to demonstrate the use of MathLibrary to make things like movement, scaling, rotation and other things easier.

Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move. The "goal" is to touch the big circle that shows up on screen. Upon touching it the game will close.

        I couldn't figure out how to implement acceleration so it's still not in the program
